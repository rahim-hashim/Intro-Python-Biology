## Final Project

The class will incorporate a final project for groups of 3-4 students. The project will be mostly open-ended, but will require using the tools learned over the course to implement. All code will be posted for future years of the class to look back on. Additionally, the final class will be allocated for short presentations by each group. 

More information will be provided once the first class has been administered and there is a better sense of how many students will participate.
